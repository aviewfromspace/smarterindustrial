HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of contentâ€”using, for example, fonts or colors.
As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.
CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa.
