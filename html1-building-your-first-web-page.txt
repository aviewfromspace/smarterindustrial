HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, for example, fonts or colors.
As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.
CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa.

Common HTML Terms:

Terms you should be most familiar with:
*Elements - Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page.
Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, < >, surrounding the element name.
>Headings <h1> - <h6>
>Paragraphs <p>

*Tags
The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a tag. 
Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.
The content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. 

*Attributes
Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element.
The most common attributes include:
>id attribute, which identifies an element; 
>class attribute, which classifies an element; 
>src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content;
>href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.
Generally attributes include a name and a value. The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted attribute value.

HTML documents are plain text documents saved with an .html file extension

All HTML documents have a required structure that includes the following declaration and elements: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>.

The document type declaration, or <!DOCTYPE html>, informs web browsers which version of HTML is being used and is placed at the very beginning of the HTML document.

the <html> element signifies the beginning of the document.

the <head> element identifies the top of the document, including any metadata (accompanying information about the page).

All of the visible content within the web page will fall within the <body> element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>

When an element is placed inside of another element, also known as nested, it is a good idea to indent that element to keep the document structure well organized and legible.

In the previous example, the <meta> element had only one tag and didn’t include a closing tag. Other common selfclosing elements include:
<br><embed><hr><img><input><link><meta><param><source><wbr>
