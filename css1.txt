>selectors, properties, and values

As elements are added to a web page, they may be styled using CSS.
Selectors - A selector designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and apply styles (such as color, size, and position) to.
Selectors generally target an attribute value, such as an id or class value, or target the type of element, such as <h1> or <p>.
Within CSS, selectors are followed with curly brackets, {}, which encompass the styles to be applied to the selected element. 
The selector here is targeting all <p> elements: 
p{...}

Properties - Once an element is selected, a property determines the styles that will be applied to that element. 
Property names fall after a selector, within the curly brackets, {}, and immediately preceding a colon, :.
In the following code, we are defining the color and font-size properties to be applied to all <p> elements.
p {
  color: ...;
  font-size: ...;
}

Values - Now we can determine the behavior of that property with a value.
Values can be identified as the text between the colon, :, and semicolon, ;. 
p {
  color: orange;
  font-size: 16px;
}
