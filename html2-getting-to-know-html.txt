Semantics within HTML is the practice of giving content on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element.
Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content.
There are several benefits to using semantic elements, including enabling computers, screen readers, search engines, and other devices to adequately read and understand the content on a web page.

Divisions, or <div>s, and <span>s are HTML elements that act as containers solely for styling purposes. 
As generic containers, they do not come with any overarching meaning or semantic value. 
Both <div>s and <span>s, however, are extremely valuable when building a website in that they give us the ability to apply targeted styles to a contained set of content.
A <div> is a block-level element that is commonly used to identify large groupings of content, and which helps to build a web page’s layout and design.
A <span>, on the other hand, is an inline-level element commonly used to identify smaller groupings of text within a block-level element.

Block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width. Block-level elements may be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements. We’ll most commonly see block-level elements used for larger pieces of content, such as paragraphs.

Inline-level elements do not begin on a new line. They fall into the normal flow of a document, lining up one after the other, and only maintain the width of their content. Inline-level elements may be nested inside one another; however, they cannot wrap block-level elements. We’ll usually see inline-level elements with smaller pieces of content, such as a few words.

We’ll commonly see <div>s and <span>s with class or id attributes for styling purposes.
Choosing a class or id attribute value, or name, requires a bit of care. We want to choose a value that refers to the content of an element, not necessarily the appearance of an element.

<!-- Division -->
<div class="social">
  <p>I may be found on...</p>
  <p>Additionally, I have a profile on...</p>
</div>

<!-- Span -->
<p>Soon we'll be <span class="tooltip">writing HTML</span> with the best of them.</p>
