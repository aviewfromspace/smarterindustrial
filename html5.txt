HTML5:
>New features should be based on HTML, CSS, the DOM, and JavaScript
*Markup should replace scripting (i.e., get rid of the coding and use a tag instead)

Request response cycle:
Servers: Machines that hold shared resources
Clients: Machines for personal use
Client (computer) requests a page and a server responds with the appropriate files.
URL has 3 parts:
Protocol - how to connect
Domain - the server
Document (optional) - the specific file needed (most pages are made up of multiple files)
Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS (more secure), FTP (file transfer protocol) - can be any type of file instead of just HTML
Domain: Identifies the entity you want to connect to. Domain name is mapped to an address. top-level domain (e.g., .com)
Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the communication protocol that identifies computers on networks
>Every computer has a unique IP address
The Domain Name Server (DNS) looks up the Domain name (URL) and return the IP address
The last part of the URL is the Document. If no document is specified, the default document is returned (e.g., index.html)

Once the IP address is determined, the browser creates an HTTP request
>Lots of hidden information in this request (e.g., header, cookies, form data)
The server returns files, not "web pages"
If the server can't fulfill the request it will send back files with error codes (e.g., 404 (you typed something wrong) or 500 (server error)).

1. decide how you will organize your files
2. decide on a naming convention
>dashes -, camelCase
>no spaces, consistent capitalization
3. decide on an editor


week2
Document Object Model (DOM)
root element <html>
 element <head>
  element <title>
    text "my title"
 element <body>
  element <h1>
    text "my header"
  element <a> - attribute "href"
    text "my link"
    
Three parts of a well-formed document:
Doctype - Version of HTML that you will be using
Head - Metadata
Body - Displayable content

Doctype: In HTML5 - <!DOCTYPE html>

Head: Additional information used by the browser
>Metadata - language, title (only thing that is displayed), supporting files (css, javascript)

Body: write well formatted code
>Always use beginning and end tags
>Close inner tags before outer ones
>Use valid attributes
Use a validator to check code: http://validator.w3.org/
